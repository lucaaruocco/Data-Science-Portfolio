# 🎓 Barcelona School of Economics – Summer School 2025

## 📍 Program
**Quantitative Methods for Public Policy Evaluation**  
The main challenge in policy evaluation is establishing a **causal link** between interventions and outcomes.  
This course introduced the **main econometric approaches** used for the evaluation of public policies, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in terms of **internal and external validity**.

---

## 🛠️ Topics covered
- **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**  
- **Regression Discontinuity Designs (RDD)**  
- **Selection on Observables** (linear regression, matching)  
- **(Dynamic) Difference-in-Differences**  
- **Synthetic Control Methods**

---

## 📂 Learning format
- **Morning sessions** → theoretical lectures with applications in *labor economics, health economics, development economics, and the economics of education*.  
- **Afternoon sessions** → empirical replication of prominent published studies using **Stata** and **R**, with data and code provided to participants.  

---

## 🚀 Skills developed
- Ability to apply causal inference methods to real-world policy evaluation problems.  
- Proficiency in replicating published studies using **Stata** and **R**.  
- Understanding of the trade-offs between different econometric strategies in terms of **validity and applicability**.  

---

## 📂 Repository content
- `certificate.pdf` → official certificate of participation.  
- `BSE_exercises.do` → consolidated Stata do-file with all replication exercises.  
- `project/` → additional applied case studies (Stata and R).  

---

## 📂 Exercises
All empirical replications from the course have been consolidated into a single Stata do-file:

- [`BSE_exercises.do`](./BSE_exercises.do)

### 📌 Content
The file is structured into five sections, each corresponding to one of the main methods covered in the Summer School:
1. **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**
2. **Regression Discontinuity Designs (RDD)**
3. **Selection on Observables (Regression, Matching)**
4. **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**
5. **Synthetic Control Methods**

### ▶️ How to run
Open `BSE_exercises.do` in **Stata** and execute the sections of interest.  
The code is organized and commented to mirror the course structure, allowing users to easily replicate the analyses and adapt them to new datasets.

👉 These exercises replicate results from prominent published studies and illustrate the practical application of modern causal inference techniques.  

---

👉 This program provided solid foundations in **causal inference and econometric evaluation methods**, essential tools for applied research in economics and public policy.
