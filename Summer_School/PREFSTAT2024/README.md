# 🎓 PREFSTAT 2024 – Summer School on Preference Statistics

## 📍 Program
**Preference Statistics** is a rapidly growing field at the intersection of **statistics, machine learning, and applied social sciences**, focused on the analysis of preferences, rankings, ratings, clicks, and other forms of ordinal data.  
The school provided a comprehensive introduction to **statistical learning for preference information**, combining lectures by internationally leading scholars with supervised tutorials in **R**.

Applications of preference statistics span **marketing, psychology, economics, and political science**, making it a multidisciplinary and high-impact area of modern data science.
